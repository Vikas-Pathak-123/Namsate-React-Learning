### ðŸ“¦ About npm

`npm` is the default package manager for JavaScript and Node.js projects.  
It helps developers install, manage, and share packages (libraries, tools, frameworks) with ease.

Despite common belief, **npm doesnâ€™t officially stand for "Node Package Manager"** â€” itâ€™s simply **npm**.
